""We want someone who can speak for the royal family,"" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. ""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary."" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. ""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. ""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue."" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton. ""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more."" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. ""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. ""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. ""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy."" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. ""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government."" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. ""These people have a lot of followers in the street.

3,CLIFF,"Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. ""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. ""That seems fairer to me,"" he added. The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added.",Prime Minister David Cameron has said councils should be allowed to sell off social housing in the most expensive areas of the UK to raise money to build more affordable homes.,BART,1,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher in Asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was ""very disappointing"".
""Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [Southeast Asia], which adds more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule,"" he added.
Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in May 2014.

Document: Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but

It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. ""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. ""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.

11,CLIFF,"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. ""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says.

Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. ""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago."" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious"". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier. ""The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.""

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for ""rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing"".","Lettings agency Investing Solutions has been paid more than £ 2.1 m in housing benefit by a London charity, the BBC has learned.",BART,0,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

15,CLIFF,"Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says. ""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. ""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. ""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. ""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. ""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. ""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. ""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. ""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. ""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses.

Document: Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because

16,CLIFF,"It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""","Poorer young people are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system than their better - off counterparts, according to a new study.",BART,1,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

18,CLIFF,"It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",The US Navy is taking part in its largest ever anti-submarine warfare exercise in the waters off the coast of the UK.,BART,1,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected

Document: David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.

A spokesman added: ""Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.""
The Isle of Man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.
Due to its potential impact on the Manx fishing industry, the Manx government began monitoring radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea in 1989.
A government spokesman said: ""Seafood fished in Manx waters can contain traces of radio-nuclides associated with effluent discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea, therefore these are monitored regularly to confirm that they remain well below maximum safe limits.""
The BBC investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant.
He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants.
The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about ""the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos"".
A spokesman added: ""However we are content that Sellafield Ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation.
""The government has asked questions about the technical solutions being developed to decommission these redundant structures and representatives have visited the site to look at the work under way"".

Document: The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury. However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected. Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later. He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side. There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby. Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy.

39,CLIFF,"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.

Document: The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.

Document: Monitor is looking into the financial sustainability of Southend University Hospital Foundation Trust ""on behalf of patients"", the NHS regulator said. Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said: ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. ""We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.""

Document: The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement. The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added. The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said ""this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual"". Africa Live: More on this and other stories The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US: Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual. ""It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."" The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube. The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground. Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.

It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

Some critics from within the party are already saying they're worried he won't have the clout or the vision to make the huge and rapid improvement needed to keep government commissioners at bay. The former Labour group leader's departure followed two other senior party figures, who resigned after criticising the way city was being run. Ian Ward, the deputy leader of the local authority and councillor Barry Henley also stood for the position. Mr Clancy, a former teacher and lecturer, has also pledged to widen access to free school meals for primary school children and expand regeneration outside the city centre. Birmingham City Council has found itself under scrutiny from a government-appointed independent panel. The panel was appointed at Sir Bob Kerslake's recommendation to oversee changes at the council. Sir Bob's study was commissioned after a series of reports focussed on the council during an inquiry into the so-called Trojan Horse letter.

Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. ""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary."" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. ""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. ""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue."" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton. ""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more."" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. ""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. ""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. ""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy."" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. ""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government."" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. ""These people have a lot of followers in the street.

78,CLIFF,"Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to. ""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads. ""That seems fairer to me,"" he added. The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority. 'Dramatic erosion' Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"". Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added.","Councils in England should consider selling off some of their social housing stock, David Cameron's spokesman has said.

Document: Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"". ""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. ""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already. ""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. ""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. ""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at."" But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods."" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but

It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume. A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said. Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts. ""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that."" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite. But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice. The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday. In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes. ""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away. Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde. ""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.

86,CLIFF,"It says something for the way the team have fallen from past greatness that the result they are talking about is the fourth row of the grid - or the third if things go especially well - and some decent points. This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid. Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine. Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit. This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history. In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races. They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'. They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari. But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information. There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan. Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too. In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline. Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970. Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda. But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now. So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another. Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season. So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again? Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return. It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title. This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007. The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end. Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too. They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it. But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. ""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.

It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees. ""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal. ""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years. ""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga."" As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year. ""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.

88,CLIFF,"Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"". Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. ""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made."" Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low."" Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"". He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for ""rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing"".","One of London's biggest letting agents has received more than £ 2m in housing benefit, the BBC has learned.",Pegasus,1,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

90,CLIFF,"Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says. ""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards."" Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there. ""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street. ""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street. ""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one. ""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm. ""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street. ""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool. ""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him. ""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'"" But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards. As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the ""Stab in the Back"" is a Pizza Express. Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline.

Document: Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday. For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers. Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius. Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years. He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats. Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides. ""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here. ""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'."" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women. He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff. ""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying."" Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about. ""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time."" His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"". ""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago."" Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"". Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs. Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail. ""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""","Poorer children in Scotland are more likely to be involved in crime, according to a new study.",Pegasus,1,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

93,CLIFF,"It is seen as a response to the growing threat from Russian submarines which have stepped up their own patrols in these very same waters. It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain's own defences. For now though it is the hunt for U33, not Red October. The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves. U33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships. Their task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker. When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search. He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity. There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK. He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time. Often the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves. They lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and ""fingerprinting"" other nations' submarines and warships. For this exercise, curiously named ""Dynamic Mongoose"", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search. For the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean. Scientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed. It is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea. Ryan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise. They are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance. Underwater drones are for the future. But for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean. For this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft. Inside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below. Britain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences. Several times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters. RUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a ""key vulnerability"". He says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland. Britain, he says, should be ""exceptionally worried"" that it is seen as a ""soft touch"", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare. But it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone. The lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review. The search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.",Nato's biggest ever anti-submarine exercise is under way off the coast of Britain.,Pegasus,1,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

He says the training ""focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare"". For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy. It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope. Down below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship. He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines. But when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: ""I wouldn't want to comment on that,"" before adding: ""In general, we're always on the lookout."" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy. But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength. While many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his. Russia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters. Earlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the ""quietest submarine in the world"". Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development. He describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled. They are, he says, the ""quietest and most challenging adversary in the world"". When out on patrol they can go undetected

Document: David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday. ""The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline,"" he said. ""We are clearly at a delicate juncture."" The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.

A spokesman added: ""Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.""
The Isle of Man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.

The BBC investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant.
He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants.
The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about ""the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos"".
A spokesman added: ""However we are content that Sellafield Ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation.

Document: The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury. However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected. Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later. He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side. There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby. Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy.

Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work. People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary. However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached.

114,CLIFF,"The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: ""The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.""",The NHS in England is being urged to do more to cut the cost of agency staff.,Pegasus,1,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

Document: The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: ""The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.""

A spokesman added: ""Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.""
The Isle of Man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.
Due to its potential impact on the Manx fishing industry, the Manx government began monitoring radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea in 1989.
A government spokesman said: ""Seafood fished in Manx waters can contain traces of radio-nuclides associated with effluent discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea, therefore these are monitored regularly to confirm that they remain well below maximum safe limits.""
The BBC investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant.
He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants.
The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about ""the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos"".
A spokesman added: ""However we are content that Sellafield Ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation.
""The government has asked questions about the technical solutions being developed to decommission these redundant structures and representatives have visited the site to look at the work under way"".

135,CLIFF,"My sources include collectors all over the world, dealers, auctions, flea markets, and just about any place I can think of. The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.","For the past 15 years, I have been collecting matchbox labels.",Pegasus,0,"Document: On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.

Document: My sources include collectors all over the world, dealers, auctions, flea markets, and just about any place I can think of. The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.

Document: Seven firms, including major supermarkets such as NTUC FairPrice and IKEA, have been asked declare they are not doing so within a week.

The state-owned supermarket giant said that it was removing all paper products sourced from Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the notification from the government. APP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze. What is behind the South East Asia haze? In a joint statement, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have ""not procured or used wood, paper and/or pulp materials"" from firms accused of contributing to the fires. The SEC said retailers were ""a good starting point"" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and ""for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices"" The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region. It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month, in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia. Anger has been rising in the region, with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations.

Thai police said the event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand could ""have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam"".
It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month.
The HRW report describes what it says is the persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the Vietnamese government as ""evil"".
Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher in Asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was ""very disappointing"".
""Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [Southeast Asia], which adds more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule,"" he added.
Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in May 2014.

The BBC investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant.
He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants.
The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about ""the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos"".
A spokesman added: ""However we are content that Sellafield Ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation.
""The government has asked questions about the technical solutions being developed to decommission these redundant structures and representatives have visited the site to look at the work under way"".

The Mannin Branch of the Celtic League has called on the Manx government to campaign for a full, independent inspection of the plant in Cumbria.
Sellafield says the site is safe and has been improved with significant investment in recent years.
A spokesman added: ""Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.""
The Isle of Man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.
Due to its potential impact on the Manx fishing industry, the Manx government began monitoring radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea in 1989.
A government spokesman said: ""Seafood fished in Manx waters can contain traces of radio-nuclides associated with effluent discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea, therefore these are monitored regularly to confirm that they remain well below maximum safe limits.""
The BBC investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant.
He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants.
The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about ""the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos"".
A spokesman added: ""However we are content that Sellafield Ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation.
""The government has asked questions about the technical solutions being developed to decommission these redundant structures and representatives have visited the site to look at the work under way"".

Document: Thai officials said the event, which was halted minutes before it was due to start, could have affected relations between the two countries.
The HRW report focuses on the treatment of a Christian group in Vietnam.
The group said the Thai response showed how freedom of speech had been eroded since the army seized power last year.
Thai police said the event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand could ""have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam"".
It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month.
The HRW report describes what it says is the persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the Vietnamese government as ""evil"".
Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher in Asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was ""very disappointing"".
""Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [Southeast Asia], which adds more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule,"" he added.
Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in May 2014.
